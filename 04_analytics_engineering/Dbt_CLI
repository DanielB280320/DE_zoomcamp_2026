    Target switching dev vs production: 
    - dbt test -t prod # Let us specify the target dev/prod when we want to run a command

    Model selection with upstream/downstream dependencies: 
    - dbt run --select stg_green_tripdata # Will execute the selected model. 
    -dbt run --select +int_trips_unioned # Build all the previous models needed to create the current one. 
    -dbt run --select int_trips_unioned+ # Build all the afterward models that depends on the current one. 
    -dbt run --select models/intermediate # Run all models in the specified dir.
