Dbt CLI: 

    Project setup commands: 
    - dbt init # Initialize and build a dbt project 
    - dbt debug # Check profile.yml file to test the connection to the datasource
    - dbt seed # Ingest all .csv that are in the seeds folder
    - dbt snapshot # Create a snapshot of the data in the source tables to track changes over time.
    - dbt source freshness # Check the freshness of the data in the source tables.
    - dbt docs generate # Generate an artifact catalog.json
    - dbt docs serve # Serve the documentation in a local server. It will open a new tab in the browser with the documentation of our project.

    Documentation and features: 
    - dbt clean # Clean all data that is stored in dbt targets
    - dbt deps # Install all dbt packages. 
    - dbt compile # Compile all the models in our project and create the .sql files in the target/compiled folder.

    Core workflow: 
    - dbt run # It run every single model at the same time within our project and materialize it. 
    - dbt test # Check all text within our dbt project.
    - dbt build # Execute dbt run + dbt test + dbt seed + dbt snapshot + UDFs. 
    - dbt retry # Execute again the previous command that fail. 

    Important flags: 
    - dbt --help # Overview of all commands available
    - dbt -V  
    - dbt run --full-refresh # Upload all data from scratch even if we are working with incremental models. 
    - dbt run --fail-fast # Stop the execution of the command if any model fails.

    Target switching dev vs production: 
    - dbt test -t prod # Run all tests in the production environment.

    Model selection with upstream/downstream dependencies: 
    - dbt run --select stg_green_tripdata # Will execute the selected model. 
    - dbt run --select +int_trips_unioned # Build all the previous models needed to create the current one. 
    - dbt run --select int_trips_unioned+ # Build all the afterward models that depends on the current one. 
    - dbt run --select models/intermediate # Run all models in the specified dir. 

    Advanced - state-based deployments and artifacts:
    - dbt run --select state:modified --state ./target # Run only the models that have been modified since the last run.
